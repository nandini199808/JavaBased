# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master  # or your branch

pool:
  name: myagent  # <<< your self-hosted agent pool name

steps:
- script: echo "Hello from self-hosted agent!"
  displayName: 'Run a script'
